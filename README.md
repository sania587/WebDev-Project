Project Overview
The web page is built with HTML and CSS to create a visually engaging landing page. It combines a video background that automatically plays in a loop and muted, ensuring a pleasant user experience. On top of the video background, animated text elements are displayed to add a captivating visual effect.

HTML Structure
The HTML structure of this project is straightforward, featuring an HTML5 document layout with the following key elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
<html>: The opening tag for the HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata and links to external resources, including an apple touch icon and various sizes of favicon icons.
<title>: Sets the title of the web page.
<link>: Links an external CSS stylesheet named "style.css."
<body>: Contains the main content of the web page.
<video>: This is the key element responsible for the video background. It uses the autoplay, muted, and loop attributes to create an infinite loop of a video. A fallback message is displayed for browsers that do not support HTML5 video.
<h1>: The main heading element containing a series of <span> elements that make up the animated text.
CSS Styles
The CSS code is responsible for styling the webpage and creating the animations. It includes the following key styles and animations:

body: Resets default margin and padding, sets overflow to hidden, and ensures that the video background takes up the entire viewport.
#background-video: Positions the video element to cover the entire viewport as a fixed element, ensuring it remains behind other content.
h1: Styles the text elements, including color, font size, line height, and text shadow. The text is centered both horizontally and vertically to create a visually pleasing effect.
h1 span: These styles control the individual text elements. They have relative positioning, are animated with a scale effect, and have a slight delay to create an alternating animation effect.
@keyframes animation: Defines the keyframes for the text animation, creating a subtle scaling effect along with a text shadow change for added visual appeal.
Usage
To use this code in your project, follow these steps:

By following these steps, you can quickly implement a similar video background with animated text on your web page.
